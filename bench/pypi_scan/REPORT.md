# `aether check-py` on 1.19M lines of real PyPI code

**Date:** 2026-07-26
**Question:** `bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md` measures against ground truth
this repo wrote, and says so. What does the tool do on a large body of
third-party code nobody wrote for it?

**Reproduce:** `python -B bench/pypi_scan/run_scan.py` (`--json` for every
finding). The corpus is the active interpreter's `site-packages` —
published PyPI distributions already on disk. Nothing is downloaded,
imported, or executed; files are read as text and parsed with `ast`.

**Headline, stated first: no vulnerability was discovered.** 39
non-test findings across 111 distributions, and triage below classifies
roughly two-thirds as a documented over-flag. What the scan did produce
is a robustness result, a precision number that is not author-supplied,
and one genuine defect in the frontend.

---

## 1. Corpus and robustness

| | |
|---|---|
| distributions | 111 |
| `.py` files | 5,588 |
| files that failed to parse | **0** |
| SLOC (non-blank, non-comment) | **1,192,484** |
| analyzer crashes | **0** |

Zero crashes and zero parse failures across 1.19M lines is the single
most reusable number here. `passes/__init__.py` deliberately does not
catch exceptions — *"a crashing detector must go red, not silent"* — so
this is an unguarded run. It is also the strongest available answer to
BUG-003, the crash that reached `main` earlier the same day: the shape
that triggered it does not recur across this corpus.

## 2. Findings

Default row set — exactly what `check-py` prints (E0713, E0714, E0718,
E0719, E0720, E0723, E0727; `effects`/`semantic`/`capability` skipped,
E0711 held back). `test_pypi_scan_row_set_matches_cli` fails the build if
the scan and the CLI drift apart.

| | count | per KLOC |
|---|---|---|
| all findings | 170 | 0.143 |
| **outside test directories** | **39** | **0.033** |
| E0711 (held back, `--strict` only) | 476 | 0.399 |

Bundled test suites deliberately contain unsafe shapes, so they are
counted separately rather than dropped — 131 of the 170 are in test
directories.

**E0711 fires 12× more often than the entire default set combined.** The
decision to demote it, taken in `bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md` on a
76-module corpus, holds at 15× the scale.

## 3. Triage of all 39 non-test findings

Read at the source line, not counted.

| Class | n | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| distutils/setuptools `Command.execute(func, args)` | ~22 | **False positive** — the documented method-name over-flag |
| `defusedxml` hardened parsers | 2 | **False positive** — guard is a function return |
| `mcp/cli` `shell=<computed>` | 1 | **False positive** — the documented cost of BUG-004 |
| pickle over a channel the caller owns (`anyio`, `jinja2` bytecode cache) | ~4 | True by shape, safe in context |
| dynamic shell in developer tooling (`pip`, `PIL`, `fire`) | ~7 | True by shape, local-trust context |
| worth a human look | 3 | see below |

**The dominant false positive is exactly the one q5 predicts.**
`setuptools/_distutils/cmd.py` defines `Command.execute(func, args, msg)`
— a *shell-command runner*, not a DB cursor — and `SINK_BY_METHOD` maps
`execute` → `sqlQuery` from the method name alone. q5's answer says this
is legitimate because the error direction is an over-flag. This scan puts
a number on that argument for the first time: **~22 of 39, about 56%, of
non-test findings come from that one rule.**

The three worth a look, none of them a vulnerability:

- `pip/_internal/commands/configuration.py:239` —
  `subprocess.check_call(f'{editor} "{fname}"', shell=True)`. A config-set
  editor interpolated into a shell string. Local-trust by design; the
  shape is textbook CWE-78.
- `pydantic/deprecated/parse.py:54` — `pickle.loads(bb)` behind an
  `allow_pickle` flag. Deprecated by pydantic partly for this reason.
- `prompt_toolkit/formatted_text/html.py:35` —
  `minidom.parseString(f"<html-root>{value}</html-root>")`. `minidom`
  is entity-expansion-prone; `value` is developer-authored in practice.

## 4. A defect the scan found

Before this run, an unmapped Python call reached the detectors under its
**raw Python spelling**, sharing a namespace with Aether's sink names. Any
method merely *spelled* like a sink became one without passing through
the mapping table:

```python
self.redirect(uri)        # -> E0718
self.renderTemplate(x)    # -> E0719
```

Neither is in `SINK_BY_QUALIFIED`, `SINK_BY_METHOD`, or anything
`mapping_table()` exposes. It over-flags rather than misses, so it is not
a soundness bug — but an **unmapped, unauditable sink** is precisely what
the auditable-surface design exists to prevent, and it would have been
invisible to anyone reviewing the tables.

Fixed by prefixing the fallback (`py:<spelling>`), pinned by
`test_unmapped_call_cannot_collide_with_an_aether_sink_name`.

Effect on the numbers, which is why this report shows both:

| | before fix | after |
|---|---|---|
| all findings | 187 | **170** |
| non-test | 53 | **39** |
| E0718 | 13 | **0** |
| E0720 | 11 | **7** |

**Every one of tornado's and websockets' E0718 hits was this collision.**
26% of the non-test findings were noise from an unmapped rule.

## 5. What this does and does not establish

**Does:**
- The frontend survives 1.19M lines of unfamiliar real code without a
  crash or a parse failure.
- The default row set is quiet on real code: 0.033 findings/KLOC outside
  tests — one finding per ~30,000 lines.
- The E0711 demotion was correct, confirmed at 15× the original scale.
- q5's method-name over-flag now has a measured cost (~56% of non-test
  findings) instead of an argument.

**Does not:**
- **Find a vulnerability.** No 0-day, and the three flagged shapes are
  local-trust or already-deprecated code.
- Measure recall. This corpus has no known-vulnerability ground truth, so
  it says nothing about what was missed — and the missing-half question is
  the one that matters most. `bench/py_frontend/` is still the only
  false-negative measurement, and it is author-established.
- Generalize beyond installed libraries. Application code — web handlers
  taking request data — is where these rows are aimed, and 111 libraries
  are not that.
