"""Security risk ratings for diagnostic codes — the triage axis.

Aether already has a `severity` on every `Diagnostic` (`error` /
`warning` / `info`). That axis answers "does the run fail?" — it is a
GATE decision, and `passes/__init__.py` depends on its current values.

This module adds the second axis a scanner needs: "of the 4,000 findings
in this corpus, which do I read first?". The ratings borrow nuclei's
five-level vocabulary (info/low/medium/high/critical) because SARIF
consumers, GitHub Code Scanning and every security dashboard already
speak it.

A rating is a TRIAGE HEURISTIC, not a measurement. It is a fixed
judgement about the class the code names — the blast radius a violation
of that class typically has — not about the specific finding. It is not
CVSS and must never be presented as one; two E0713 findings can differ
by orders of magnitude in real impact.

Non-security codes (lex, parse, harness, SMT timeout) rate `info`. That
is not a claim that a parse error is unimportant — the compiler refuses
it regardless, via `severity`. It means a parse error is not a finding a
security reviewer triages.

The table is read only by output layers (`tools/scan.py`). No detector
imports it and no `Diagnostic` construction site changes, which is why
adding it moves no existing behaviour.
