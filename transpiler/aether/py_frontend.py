"""Python -> Aether-IR translation frontend.

THIS FILE DOES NOT ANALYZE. It TRANSLATES Python source into the exact
dict-AST shape the existing Aether passes (`aether.passes.capability`,
`aether.passes.effects`) and the dashboard projection (`tools.alsp_surface`)
already consume, then lets those untouched passes do the proving.

The mapping from Python constructs to capability/effect signals is the
analysis surface, and it is intentionally explicit and auditable below:

    CAP_BY_MODULE      import name        -> capability        (whole module)
    CAP_BY_QUALIFIED   module.attr        -> capability        (specific call)
    CAP_BY_BUILTIN     builtin name       -> (capability,verb)
    DYNAMIC_BUILTINS   builtin name       -> reason            (UNPROVABLE)
    PURE_MODULES       import name        -> resolvable, no capability
    PURE_BUILTINS      builtin name       -> resolvable, no capability

SOUNDNESS DISCIPLINE (the whole point of the Python experiment):
  A call whose capability surface we CANNOT determine is NEVER assumed
  clean. It is emitted as an UNPROVABLE record. We only treat a call as
  capability-free when it is (a) a local function, (b) a known-pure
  builtin, or (c) a call into a known-pure module. Everything else —
  unmapped imports, methods on unknown objects, dynamic dispatch — is
  UNPROVABLE. This is why real Python may collapse to UNPROVABLE; the
  experiment is to measure exactly how much.

# Every value here must be a sink string that appears in

# string matches no row and would silently do nothing.
#
# WHY MATCHING BY METHOD NAME IS LEGITIMATE HERE, having been unsound for
# purity (see the PURE_METHODS note further down):
#   Clearing `obj.append()` as pure from the method NAME, with no proof of
#   the receiver's type, certified a capability-using module CLEAN — a
#   silent false negative, the contract-breach class (trap_04).
#   Treating `cursor.execute(...)` as a SQL sink from the method name,
#   with exactly the same absence of proof, can only produce a finding on
#   code that was not a sink — an over-flag.
#   One rule covers both: never assume clean from a name; freely assume
#   dangerous from a name. The asymmetry is not a double standard, it is
#   the direction of the error.
