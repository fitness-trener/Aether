"""Declarative catalog of the two repeated detector shapes, and the two
drivers that read it.

Thirteen of `passes/effects.py`'s detectors were the same two shapes
written out thirteen times:

  * **marker-flow** (6 rows) — a value carrying a taint marker reaches a
    sink without passing through that marker's sanctioned exit.
  * **literal-or-wrapper** (7 rows) — an argument at a sink must be a
    fixed literal or the result of a sanctioned wrapper call. Anything
    else is reported with a short *reason* that lands in the message.

Both tables are data. `marker_flow(spec)` and `literal_or_wrapper(spec)`
turn one row into a `check_*(ast) -> [Diagnostic]` function, and
`effects.py` binds and re-exports the generated names, so every existing
import site (`tests/test_effect_scope.py`'s 26, `passes/__init__.py`'s
`STAGES`) is untouched.

Diagnostic prose is product surface: demo `REPORT.md` files quote it and
the fix-loop agent reads `suggestion` to repair code. Each row therefore
carries its message and suggestion as format templates, and the
per-sink wording (`Sink.where`) travels with the sink — so no driver
ever branches on a diagnostic code.

The marker taint machinery lives here too: it exists to serve these rows
plus E0729/E0730, and putting it beside the drivers is what keeps the
dependency one-way (`effects.py` imports this module, never the
reverse). `effects.py` imports the pieces its remaining hand-written
detectors still need.

Analysis limits are unchanged by this refactor. These passes are
syntactic and intraprocedural: they over-flag rather than miss within
the modeled surface, and are not a soundness proof. Recorded residuals:
`vault/wiki/questions/q1-taint-marker-soundness-boundary.md`.
