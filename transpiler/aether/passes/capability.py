"""Capability-gating pass (Phase B.3 — transitive, default-on).

Walks the AST once, computes the effective effect set for every
FunctionDecl (declared direct effects ∪ transitive effects of every
function reachable through direct calls), and asserts each effect's
required capability is covered by some module's `requires capability`
declaration.

Default-on behaviour:
  - If at least one `module ... end` is declared in the program, the check
    is enforced strictly. Any uncovered capability emits E0701.
  - If no module is declared, the program is treated as living in an
    implicit "global" capability scope that grants all capabilities —
    the check silently passes. This is a pragmatic transition until
    Phase D.3 makes modules real composition units. Documented in
    SPEC_ISSUES; once D.3 ships, programs without modules will emit
    a warning by default.

Effect-to-capability mapping (B.3 keeps v0.2 mapping):

    pure                  → no capability required
    panic                 → no capability required (always available)
    mutate(_)             → no capability required (module-local mutation)
    log, random           → log, random respectively
    fs.<anything>         → fs
    net.<anything>        → net
    db.<anything>         → db
    exec.<anything>       → exec
    time.<anything>       → time
    other.<anything>      → first segment of the dotted path

Diagnostic codes:
  E0701  uncovered transitive effect — function's effective effect set
         contains a path whose required capability isn't declared by any
         module. The diagnostic always points at the *immediate* function
         declaring the effect (or the function up the call chain that
         introduces it via a transitive callee).
  E0702  reserved for cross-module capability violations once Phase D.3
         lands real module scoping.

Limits / known gaps (v1 scope):
  - "Transitive" here means "via direct function calls within this
     program file" — a single AST. Cross-file module composition is
     Phase D.3 work.
  - HOFs / function-typed parameters / let-bound function values are
    treated as pure for the call-graph build. Effect leakage through
    a HOF is caught by B.1 at the call site that passes the function in.
  - A program with no module declarations is treated as having an
    implicit all-capability grant. Surface this in the audit if a YC
    partner asks "what does this enforce on a script without a module?"
