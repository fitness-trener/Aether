"""H.E.3 cross-file import resolution.

Minimal multi-file resolution for the v0.3 toolchain. Resolves
`import foo` declarations to `foo.aeth` in the same directory as the
importing file, parses each imported file, recursively resolves *its*
imports, and concatenates every top-level declaration into a single
"combined" Program AST that the standard static passes
(`check_effects`, `check_capabilities`, `check_modules`) can run over
unchanged.

What this *does* support, as of v0.3:

- Single-segment imports (`import foo`) resolving to a sibling file.
- Transitive import chains (A imports B imports C).
- Cycle detection (E0706) — surfaces a structured diagnostic instead
  of recursing infinitely.
- File-not-found (E0705).

What it *does not* support — documented as v2 work in `yc/v2_ROADMAP.md`:

- Dotted import paths (`import pkg.mod`) — the parser already accepts
  them; resolution treats only the leaf segment.
- Aliased imports (`import foo as bar`) — parsed, ignored at resolution
  time; downstream name resolution is by raw decl name.
- Symbol-level export filtering — every top-level decl of an imported
  file is currently fused into the caller's namespace regardless of
  whether the importing module's `exports` clause names it.
- Per-package version pinning, package manifests, lockfiles — v2.

This is a deliberate v1 scope choice. The verification primitives
(effects, capabilities, refinements) are the contribution; package
management is the *deployment* layer that ships in v2 once the language
identity has converged.

This module is reached from the CLI when the source has at least one
`ImportDecl`. The SDK and LSP keep single-file semantics — they operate
on in-memory text without a deterministic filesystem anchor, and
multi-file resolution requires a real `source_path`.
