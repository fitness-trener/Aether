"""Static analysis passes that run between parse and exec.

`STAGES` is the single definition of which detectors exist and in what
order they run. Every caller that runs static analysis — the CLI, the
agent SDK, the LSP server, the SARIF scanner, the tests — crosses
`analyze()` / `analyze_flat()` rather than assembling its own list.
Before this registry there were four hand-maintained copies and three had
drifted (`tools/scan.py` was blind to E0207/E0729/E0730; `sdk.py`, and so
the editor, ran 2 of 30 detectors).

A stage is a named group that shares a short-circuit: `analyze()` returns
diagnostics grouped by stage so the CLI can keep printing the first
non-empty stage and stop, exactly as it did when the stages were
hand-wired functions.

SMT contract proving is deliberately NOT a stage: different signature
(`ast, timeout_ms`), an optional z3 dependency, and the only analysis
where `severity == "warning"` must not fail the run. It stays hand-wired
in `cli.py` after the loop.

No exception handling here. A pass that crashes propagates — measured 0
crashes across 799 inputs (370 whole files + 429 truncated mid-typing
buffers), and a crashing detector must go red, not silent. Liveness for
long-lived servers is the LSP request boundary's job, not analysis's.
