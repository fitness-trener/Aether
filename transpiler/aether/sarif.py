"""SARIF v2.1.0 rendering — ONE renderer, shared by every scan surface.

Two surfaces produce Code Scanning input: `tools/scan.py` over `.aeth`
corpora, and `aether check-py --sarif` over Python trees. They render the
same document from the same risk table, from here, on purpose. The scanner
already learned this lesson once about its detector list — it "used to keep
its own list, and drifted three detectors behind" (`tools/scan.py`) — and a
second SARIF renderer would be the same mistake in a place where the drift
is invisible, because a malformed or mis-ranked SARIF file is silently
dropped by GitHub rather than rejected.
