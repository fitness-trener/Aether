"""C.2 Agent SDK — the public Python surface for tool authors.

This is the "no other language has this" piece referenced in the YC
narrative: a single import gives an AI agent or build tool the entry
points it actually needs — parse, check, run, grade, edit — with
structured diagnostics shaped for fix-loops.

Public API (everything below is the supported surface):

    parse(source, filename="<sdk>")              -> ParseResult
    check(source_or_ast, filename="<sdk>")       -> CheckResult
    run(source, stdin="", timeout_ms=5000,
        deterministic=False)                     -> RunResult
    grade(source, expected_stdout, stdin="",
          timeout_ms=5000, deterministic=False)  -> GradeResult
    pretty(ast)                                  -> str
    edit(source, transform)                      -> str

`source` is always a `str` containing Aether source. The SDK is
stateless — every call is a fresh pass through the toolchain. Use the
`Source` convenience class when you want to carry source + AST +
filename together.

Diagnostics returned by the SDK are the same `aether.diagnostics.Diagnostic`
dataclass used internally — `.code`, `.message`, `.position`, `.suggestion`,
`.extra` — so anything the compiler knows about a problem is reachable
without parsing strings.

`TIMEOUT_ENFORCED` is part of this surface: False means this platform has
no POSIX SIGALRM, so `timeout_ms` is not enforced and a runaway program
hangs the caller. Each `RunResult.timeout_enforced` reports the same fact
per call.
