"""Monotonic ratchet — Aether may only improve.

The self-teaching loop edits the compiler autonomously. This gate makes the
improvement one-directional:

  1. Detector count never drops. The number of distinct diagnostic codes
     the transpiler emits, and the number of detector passes registered in
     `aether.passes.STAGES`, must meet or exceed a committed FLOOR
     (`ratchet_baseline.json`). Removing a detector — even if its code,
     doc, and test are all deleted together so the rest of the suite stays
     green — drops the count below the floor and turns THIS gate red.

  2. Gains get locked. When an iteration adds a detector, this test prints
     a reminder to raise the floor in the same commit, so the addition can
     never be silently removed later.

  3. Fixed bugs stay fixed. Every `[FIXED ...]` entry in BUGS.md must name
     a regression test that still exists, so a repaired bug cannot quietly
     reappear.

  4. Recall never drops. A detector that still EXISTS can stop finding
     things (a `return []` counts as a detector). The floor also covers
     what the detectors are proven to find: every finding the `.aeth`
     corpus claims in its `// expect:` headers (test_corpus.py holds each
     file to its claim, so the sum can only shrink by editing claims
     down), and every Python sink/sanitizer table row (tests/
     test_sink_rows.py makes each row fire).

The baseline is compared against the merge-base with origin/main, not
only HEAD: in CI, HEAD *is* the commit under test, so lowering the floor
and deleting a detector in one commit used to pass (audit 2026-09-24 F1).
