"""Python frontend — expression translation and sink detection.

`tests/test_py_soundness.py` owns the capability-table soundness contract
(nothing here may weaken it). This file owns the other half: that a Python
function BODY reaches the Aether detectors as judgeable expression shapes,
and that the sink mapping fires the right existing detector.
