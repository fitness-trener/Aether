"""Aether scanner — point it at a directory of `.aeth` files (e.g. a corpus
of AI-generated code) and get a findings report across the full detector
suite. Membership is `aether.passes.STAGES`, the same registry the CLI,
the SDK and the LSP cross — this scanner does not keep its own list (it
used to, and drifted three detectors behind).

This is the product shape of Aether's phase-2 story: not "model a known
CVE", but "scan real code and surface real issues".

Usage:
    python -m tools.scan <dir-or-file>... [--json|--sarif] [--expect] [--min-risk RATING]

Exit code: 0 if no findings, 1 if any file has findings, 2 on usage error.
Parse errors (E0201) are reported separately as generation failures, not
architectural findings.

`--expect` judges each file against the `// expect:` header it declares
(see `tools/expectations.py`) and gates on the DIFFERENCE — an unexpected
finding, or a declared one that stopped firing. A file with no header is
held to `clean`, so in a repo that uses no headers the flag changes
nothing. It exists because a repo can legitimately CONTAIN violations: a
detector's demo pair is a vulnerable file and its fix, and "any finding
fails" makes such a repo unscannable. This is what `.github/workflows/
aether-scan.yml` runs over Aether's own corpus.
