"""Aether scanner — point it at a directory of `.aeth` files (e.g. a corpus
of AI-generated code) and get a findings report across the full detector
suite. Membership is `aether.passes.STAGES`, the same registry the CLI,
the SDK and the LSP cross — this scanner does not keep its own list (it
used to, and drifted three detectors behind).

This is the product shape of Aether's phase-2 story: not "model a known
CVE", but "scan real code and surface real issues".

Usage:
    python -m tools.scan <dir-or-file>... [--json|--sarif] [--expect]
                         [--min-risk RATING] [--min-confidence FLOAT]
                         [--allow-parse-errors]

Exit code: 0 if no findings, 1 if any file has findings OR any file did not
parse, 2 on usage error. A file that does not parse (E01xx lex / E02xx
parse) was not analysed, so it is a failure, not a clean file — it used to
be counted and the run still exited 0, so a tree where EVERY file failed
to parse passed (audit 2026-09-24 D3). `--allow-parse-errors` is the
explicit opt-out for a corpus of generated code where some candidates
are known not to parse. Parse errors are reported as structured
diagnostics (`parse_error: {code, message, line, column}`), separately
from architectural findings. Files are read as `utf-8-sig`, like
`aether check`, and loaded (parse + `import` resolution) by the same
`load_program` every other surface uses.

`--expect` judges each file against the `// expect:` header it declares
(see `tools/expectations.py`) and gates on the DIFFERENCE — an unexpected
finding, or a declared one that stopped firing. A file with no header is
held to `clean`, so in a repo that uses no headers the flag changes
nothing. It exists because a repo can legitimately CONTAIN violations: a
detector's demo pair is a vulnerable file and its fix, and "any finding
fails" makes such a repo unscannable. This is what `.github/workflows/
aether-scan.yml` runs over Aether's own corpus.
