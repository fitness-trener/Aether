# Aether

**A security checker for Python, aimed at the code AI agents write and
run.**

Aether is a security checker for Python, built on the typed intermediate
representation of the Aether language. `aether check-py` translates an
unmodified Python file into that IR and runs the security rules on it;
Aether source (`.aeth`) is checked by the same rules plus the language's
effect, capability and marker-type checks, which Python code has no
declarations for.

Point it at a Python file. It finds SQL injection, command injection, code
injection through `exec`/`eval`, open redirect, SSTI, insecure
deserialization, hardcoded credentials and untrusted XML parsing (XXE
through lxml or a parser that resolves external entities) by reading each
argument's shape and where it came from, not just the name of the call. No
rewrite, no annotations, no configuration.

Sample output on this page is wrapped to fit and trimmed; `...` marks
elided text.

    $ aether check-py bench/py_frontend/corpus/sqli_repro.py
    [E0713] error (capability) at line 20, col 12: function 'find_user' builds a SQL query for
    'sqlQuery' unsafely (query is built by string concatenation - use sqlBind(...)); untrusted
    input concatenated into a query is an injection
      hint: use a fixed literal, or parameterize with sqlBind("... ? ...", value) which escapes
      the value so it cannot break out of the query
    [E0713] error (capability) at line 26, col 12: function 'find_user_fstring' builds a SQL
    query for 'sqlQuery' unsafely ...

    2 finding(s) in 3 function(s); 3 unprovable region(s) in 3 function(s).
    NOT checked on Python (no declared effects clause, no marker types): ...
    ...

`sqlBind` is Aether's name for a parameterized query; see the limits below
for how to read Aether names in findings on Python.

Exit `0` clean, `1` findings, `2` usage error (a missing path), `3`
analyzer crash, `4` incomplete (a file could not be parsed and nothing
was found), the same table for `check`, `check-py`, `fix-loop` and
`tools/scan.py` ([`docs/SCANNING.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/docs/SCANNING.md)). Every command on this page that names a path in this
repo runs from a fresh clone after `pip install .` (see Install); the two
bandit comparisons and `run_recall.py` also need
`pip install bandit==1.9.4` (without it `run_recall.py` still runs, with
no oracle results to compare).

---

## How the checks work

Aether's detectors are designed against a **typed intermediate
representation** with explicit security markers — `Authorized<T>`,
`Untrusted<T>`, `Secret<T>`, `PII<T>` — and then projected down onto plain
Python. A rule is written once against dataflow, not once per syntactic
spelling.

Two consequences you can reproduce right now.

**It reads the argument, not the call.** `bench/realworld_subprocess_cmdi/subprocess_repro.py`
holds a command injection on line 18 and its documented fix — the argv-list
form, no shell — on line 24.

    $ python -m bandit -f custom -q bench/realworld_subprocess_cmdi/subprocess_repro.py
    ...:13: B404[bandit]: LOW: Consider possible security implications associated with the subprocess module.
    ...:18: B602[bandit]: HIGH: subprocess call with shell=True identified, security issue.
    ...:24: B607[bandit]: LOW: Starting a process with a partial executable path
    ...:24: B603[bandit]: LOW: subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input.

    $ aether check-py bench/realworld_subprocess_cmdi/subprocess_repro.py
    [E0714] error (capability) at line 18, col 12: function 'make_thumbnail' builds a shell
    command for 'shellExec' unsafely ...
    ...

Both find line 18. Only one of them also warns about the fix. A checker
that flags the remediation trains people to ignore it.

**It reads literal content, not variable names.** The same corpus has an
AWS access key id in `hardcoded_secret_repro.py` (AWS's documented example
value `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`, which has the shape of a real key):

    $ python -m bandit -f custom -q bench/py_frontend/corpus/hardcoded_secret_repro.py
    (no output, exit 0)

    $ aether check-py bench/py_frontend/corpus/hardcoded_secret_repro.py
    [E0723] error (capability) at line 19, col 18: string literal contains a hardcoded AWS
    access key id; a credential in source is committed to version control and shipped in
    every build
    ...

Bandit's B105/B106 match password-*ish* variable names; `E0723` matches
provider key *shapes* (`AKIA…`, `ghp_…`, PEM blocks).

This is not a general "better than bandit" claim, and the repo says so at
length in [`bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md) §3:
bandit 1.9.4 registers 75 test ids (42 plugins plus 33 blacklisted calls
and imports) across crypto, Django, TLS and more; Aether models 9 rows on
Python (the 8 default-on codes below plus `E0711` under `--strict`;
`E0716` on `executescript` and the `net.fetch` rows on a call named
`fetch` also fire, see below).
**On breadth bandit wins outright.** The narrow claim is
the one above, and it is checkable in two commands.

## Measured on 1.19M lines nobody wrote for us

Every false-negative number in a security tool's README is usually measured
against ground truth its own authors wrote. Ours were too — so we went and
got some that weren't.

| | |
|---|---|
| PyPI distributions scanned | 111 |
| Python files / SLOC | 5,588 / **1,192,484** |
| parse failures | **0** |
| analyzer crashes | **0** |
| findings outside test dirs | 39 (**0.033 per KLOC**); 48 after the recall fixes below |
| agreement with bandit, comparable categories | **86.8%** (125 agreed / 19 candidate misses) |

Measured 2026-07-26, before 0.4.0, on whatever was installed in that
interpreter's `site-packages`. A later run on a changed install gave
different totals, and the report says so, so read these as that day's
numbers.

**No vulnerability was discovered in that corpus**, and roughly 56% of the
39 findings trace to one documented over-flag rule. Both facts are stated
up front in the reports, not buried:
[`bench/pypi_scan/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/pypi_scan/REPORT.md) (precision,
triaged line by line) and [`bench/pypi_scan/RECALL.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/pypi_scan/RECALL.md)
(recall against bandit as an independent oracle — which found **4 shapes
Aether reported nothing on**, `marshal.load`, `pickle.Unpickler(...).load()`,
`pulldom.parseString` and `xml.sax.parseString`, all reported since).

Reproduce both: `python -B bench/pypi_scan/run_scan.py` and
`python -B bench/pypi_scan/run_recall.py`.

## What it checks on Python, and what it does not

Default-on, no annotations required:

| Code | Class | CWE |
|---|---|---|
| `E0713` | SQL injection | 89 |
| `E0714` | Command injection | 78 |
| `E0718` | Open redirect | 601 |
| `E0719` | Template injection / SSTI | 94 |
| `E0720` | Insecure deserialization | 502 |
| `E0723` | Hardcoded credential | 798 |
| `E0727` | Untrusted XML parsing — dynamic input to a mapped lxml or standard-library XML parse call, whatever parser is passed, unless it is an lxml `XMLParser` bound in the same function with `resolve_entities=False` and `no_network`, `load_dtd` and `dtd_validation` left at their safe defaults or set to them as constants (the hint's `XMLParser(resolve_entities=False, no_network=True, load_dtd=False)` is one such binding). XXE through lxml before 5.0 or with `resolve_entities=True`, or through a passed parser that resolves external entities; denial of service on an older Expat. Gaps: see below the table | 611 |
| `E0731` | Code injection — `exec`/`eval`/`compile` of dynamic source | 94, 95 |

`--strict` adds `E0711` (dynamic filesystem paths) and the `E0701`
capability inventory. Both are **held back by measurement, not taste**: on
the 2026-07-26 PyPI corpus, E0711 alone fired 476 times against 170 for
that day's whole default set, both counted over every file including
bundled tests ([`bench/pypi_scan/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/pypi_scan/REPORT.md) §2).

**`E0727` is not checked yet** on: a SAX parser object's own `.parse(...)`;
`xml.etree.ElementTree.XML(...)` in any form (the same function as
`fromstring`; handed an lxml `XMLParser(resolve_entities=True)` it reads a
local file, measured),
`lxml.etree.iterparse(..., resolve_entities=True)` and
`lxml.etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=True).feed(...)`, each of which
reads a local file on lxml 6.1.1 (measured); `ElementTree.iterparse` and
`ElementTree.XMLParser().feed` (only the older-Expat denial of service
applies; no file read measured); the path or URL a `parse()` call opens.
And a hardened lxml parser passed in `xml.dom.expatbuilder.parseString`'s
second slot, which is `namespaces`, clears the finding.

A SQLAlchemy or SQLModel expression — `conn.execute(select(t).where(...))`,
built in one statement or across several, or the `table.delete()` form —
is read as the parameterized query it is, not as a dynamic string. The
line that does not move: `text(...)` or `literal_column(...)` handed a
concatenation is still an injection, nested inside a `select()` or not.
This was measured, not assumed — see
[`bench/framework_scan/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/framework_scan/REPORT.md).

**Not checked on Python**, and the CLI prints this every run rather than
letting you assume otherwise:

- `E0801` effect composition, which compares calls against a declared
  `effects` clause Python does not have.
- The `net.fetch` scope rows `E0710` (unpinned host), `E0721` (cleartext
  `http://`) and `E0722` (link-local / metadata address). They read a
  declared scope; on Python they fire only on a call named `fetch` through
  a mapped network module (`httpx.fetch(...)`), not on `requests.get`,
  `requests.post` or `urlopen` (measured).
- The marker rows `E0712`, `E0715`, `E0717`, `E0724`, `E0725`, `E0726`,
  `E0728`, `E0729` and `E0730`, which need a
  `Secret`/`PII`/`Untrusted`/`Authorized` type.
- The static-semantic family `E0202`–`E0207`: it checks Aether language
  constructs, and on translated Python it would describe the translation,
  not the program.

These run on Aether source, where the access-control rows live — see
*Where the rules come from*, below. One exception: `E0716` (missing
authorization) does fire on Python, on every `.executescript(...)` method call,
literal scripts included, because the frontend maps it to Aether's
`sqlExec`, which requires an authorization proof. No Python spelling we
tried clears it, `authorize(...)` passed as a second argument or an
`Authorized` annotation included (measured), so read it as "this call
runs a SQL script", not as a missing check.

Further limits, stated plainly: the analysis is **intraprocedural and
syntactic** — over-flag, never miss *within the modeled surface*, which is
not a soundness proof. Sinks are matched by method name on receivers of
unresolved type; those findings are rated 0.6 confidence, so they sort
below the import-resolved findings of the same risk rating. Single file, no cross-module resolution, no control flow.
Full list in [`bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/py_frontend/REPORT.md) §4.

Findings on Python still use Aether's names. Messages name the Aether sink
(`sqlQuery`, `shellExec`, `deserialize`, `evalCode`, `renderTemplate`,
`readFile`) rather than your call, and the messages or hints for `E0711`
(`--strict`), `E0713`, `E0714`, `E0718`, `E0720`, `E0723` and `E0731` name
functions Python does not have: `safeJoin`, `sqlBind`, `shellArg`,
`safeRedirect`, `schemaDecode`, `getEnv`, `trusted`. `executescript` findings name `sqlExec`, and the
`E0716` hint names `authorize` and `Authorized<String>`. Under `--strict`,
the `E0701` hint suggests an Aether `module ... requires capability`
declaration or `effects pure`; `E0710`/`E0721`/`E0722` say a function
"declares effect 'net.fetch'" when a mapped `fetch` call fires them,
though Python declares nothing. Read them as the
Python fix they stand for: a parameterized query for `sqlBind`, an argv
list or `shlex.quote` for `shellArg`, a resolved path checked to stay
under a fixed base directory for `safeJoin`, a host allow-list for
`safeRedirect`, a data-only format such as `json` validated against a
schema for `schemaDecode`, `os.environ` for `getEnv`. The `E0727` hints
name Python fixes; the `E0719` hint names no function.

## Install

Python 3.10+. The core toolchain is stdlib-only — zero third-party
packages.

    pip install aether-lang
    aether check-py <your_file.py>

From a checkout, to get the corpus and the benchmarks the commands on this
page reference:

    git clone https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether.git
    cd Aether
    pip install .

Without installing, every command works through the module path:

    python -B -m transpiler.aether.cli check-py <your_file.py>

Optional extras: `pip install '.[smt]'` adds Z3 for `--prove` contract
checking; `pip install '.[llm]'` adds the Anthropic SDK for the live
fix-loop.

Point it at a whole repository — directories are walked recursively for
`.py`, skipping `.git`, `.venv`, `node_modules`, `build` and the other
vendored trees, because a repo scan that becomes a dependency scan buries
the findings you can actually fix:

    $ aether check-py bench/realworld_subprocess_cmdi/ bench/realworld_xxe/
    bench/realworld_subprocess_cmdi/subprocess_repro.py
    [E0714] error (capability) at line 18, col 12: function 'make_thumbnail' builds a shell
    command for 'shellExec' unsafely ...
    ...
    bench/realworld_xxe/lxml_repro.py
    [E0727] error (capability) at line 17, col 12: function 'load_config' parses untrusted
    XML via lxml.etree.fromstring ...
    ...

    scanned 2 file(s) · 2 with findings · 0 unparseable · 0 analyzer error(s)
    findings by code: E0714x1, E0727x1
    ...

Findings sort worst-first by the per-code risk rating, then, within a
rating, most-certain first: a callee resolved through the file's imports
rates 0.95 confidence, a method matched only by its name on a receiver of
unknown type 0.6. `--min-confidence 0.9` hides the 0.6 findings — 628 of
676 on the 15-framework corpus (re-scanned 2026-09-11 at 0.4.0,
[`bench/framework_scan/REPORT.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/bench/framework_scan/REPORT.md);
framework versions pinned in `bench/framework_scan/frameworks.lock.txt`). It is a filter, not a verdict on what it
hides (those are what the rules flag, measured over-flags included), and
it filters the exit code too: a run whose only findings are below the
floor exits 0. On a multi-core machine, trees of more than 32 files are
analysed in parallel; `--jobs N` overrides (measured 2026-09-03 on
1,024 files: 241 s serially, 69 s on 8 workers, byte-identical output). Details in
[`docs/SCANNING.md`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/docs/SCANNING.md).

## CI and GitHub Code Scanning

Findings carry `security-severity` derived from a per-code risk table
([`risk.py`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/transpiler/aether/risk.py)), so they land in the **Security →
Code Scanning** tab already ranked, and appear inline on the PR diff.

```yaml
name: aether
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write   # required to upload SARIF

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: fitness-trener/Aether@v0.4.1
        with:
          path: 'src tests'      # default: .
          strict: 'false'        # adds E0711 + the E0701 inventory
```

Inputs: `path`, `strict`, `fail-on-findings`, `allow-incomplete`, `upload-sarif`, `sarif-file`,
`category`, `setup-python`, `python-version`. Outputs: `findings`,
`sarif-file`, `exit-code`, `unparsed`. Full contract in [`action.yml`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/action.yml).

Or drive the CLI yourself:

    aether check-py src/ --sarif > aether.sarif

`.aeth` corpora go through `tools/scan.py`, which additionally supports
`--min-risk high` as a triage filter and `--expect` for a repo that
deliberately contains violations;
[`.github/workflows/aether-scan.yml`](https://github.com/fitness-trener/Aether/blob/main/.github/workflows/aether-scan.yml)
is the working reference for that path.

## Where the rules come from

Aether is also a **language**, and that is why the detector set looks the
way it does rather than being a marketing line.

The compiler refuses to compose components that violate declared
architectural constraints — effect locality, URL discipline, module
capability scope, refinement-typed boundaries — and emits structured
diagnostics an agent fix-loop can act on mechanically. Because the type
system carries `Authorized<T>` and `Untrusted<T>` as first-class markers,
whole classes become expressible that a pattern matcher has no vocabulary
for:

- **`E0716` missing authorization** (CWE-862/863) — a data-mutating sink
  reachable with no authorization proof in its dataflow.
- **`E0717` cross-tenant access / IDOR** (CWE-639) — an authorization proof
  that is not bound to the *same resource id* the sink mutates.

Current surface: **55 diagnostic codes across 31 gated detectors**, held by
a monotonic ratchet (`tests/ratchet_baseline.json`) that turns the build red
if a detector is ever removed or weakened. Security family `E0710`–`E0731`;
static-semantic family `E0202`–`E0207` (non-exhaustive match, unreachable
arm, dead code, dead store, ignored `Result`, unsatisfiable refinement).

Working with the language directly:

    aether check demos/payment_workflow/aether/main.aeth
    aether run   demos/payment_workflow/aether/main.aeth
    aether fmt   demos/payment_workflow/aether/main.aeth
    aether fix-loop demos/payment_workflow/broken.aeth       # deterministic repair; refuses to widen a declaration (ends not_repaired, exit 1)
    aether fix-loop demos/payment_workflow/broken.aeth --allow-widen # applies widening repairs, tags each one, still exits 1
    aether fix-loop demos/payment_workflow/broken.aeth --live # LLM repair: source checkout + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

`aether --json <command> ...` (the flag goes before the command) emits
structured output for an agent to consume: exactly one JSON document on
stdout, every diagnostic as `Diagnostic.to_dict()` (`stage`,
`patch_target` and `confidence` included); the Python SDK is
`from aether import sdk` once installed (`pip install aether-lang`, or
`pip install .` from a checkout).

**Design principles.** One syntactic form per semantic operation · every
public function declares its contracts and effects · modules declare their
capabilities and, in a program that declares a module, only what is
declared is granted (a static E0701 check plus a runtime one) · the AST is
canonical (`parse(print(ast)) == ast`) · errors are structured and
suggestions are machine-readable.

**Honest framing, enforced repo-wide.** Refinement, capability and
effect-scope checks that fire at *runtime* are described as runtime
guarantees, never as static proof. Taint passes are syntactic and
intraprocedural and are described as "over-flag, never miss within the
modeled surface", never as "sound".

## Layout

    transpiler/     The compiler, runtime, CLI, Python frontend (aether/py_frontend.py) and
                    risk table (aether/risk.py) — pure Python, no third-party deps
    tools/          scan.py (SARIF scanner for .aeth corpora) and other tooling
    grammar/        Specification: keywords, types, effects, EBNF, stdlib, diagnostics catalog
    bench/          Measurement harnesses — py_frontend, pypi_scan, framework_scan, architectural
    demos/          Case studies, including the improvement-loop log
    vault/          Long-term design analysis (Karpathy LLM-wiki method)
    reference/      Reference programs with canonical AST + expected output
    tests/          Integration tests and the monotonic ratchet
    scripts/        run_all.py — the full gate

Full gate: `python -B scripts/run_all.py` (exit 0 = green; 42 PASS suites, and `smt` reports SKIP
when z3 is not installed).
